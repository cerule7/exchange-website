		<div style="float: left;"><img src="/static/img/exchangeicon.png" alt="LEA Icon"></div><div style="float: right;">This new one-credit activity allows partnerships of two students to exchange conversation in two different languages they wish to share and learn. Students are partnered up to exchange conversation in both languages with one of their peers once a week for an hour at a regular time period that fits their schedule. Language Exchange partners meet a few times with a faculty member from one of the language departments of SAS who validates the Exchange. They keep short journal entries noting the linguistic skills practiced and the cultural elements and topics discussed. For the end of the semester, they produce a five minute video presenting their exchange and highlighting all the fun they've had! <p> All student-partners who complete all LEA-Exchange assignments together will be validated by their faculty supervisor to receive 1 credit and a P grade at the end of the term. No incomplete exchange will be validated for credit, regardless of the reason why the exchange could not be completed. </p></div>
